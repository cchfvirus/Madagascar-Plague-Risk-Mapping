# Madagascar Plague Risk Mapping

# Interactive Plague Risk Mapping for Madagascar 🗺️

Plague continues to cause deadly outbreaks in Madagascar, yet health officials lack detailed maps showing where disease risk is highest. This detailed community-level risk assessment enables health authorities to target disease surveillance, prevention efforts, and resources to specific locations where plague is most likely to occur, potentially saving lives through earlier detection and response to outbreaks.
